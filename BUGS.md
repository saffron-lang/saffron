# Known Bugs

## Open

### 2. Forward references in nested closures

**Reproduction:**
```saffron
fun test() {
    fun a() { return b() }
    fun b() { return 42 }
    IO.print(a())
}
test()
```

**Expected:** Works (b is defined before a is called).
**Actual:** `Runtime error` — b is undefined when a's closure is compiled.

**Impact:** Can't write mutually recursive helper functions inside a parent scope.
**Note:** Design choice — compile-time local resolution. Same as Lua/Python.

### 6. No `break`/`continue` type checking

The compiler has break/continue infrastructure (breakJumps, continueJumps arrays) but the type checker doesn't handle NODE_BREAK/NODE_CONTINUE. Runtime works; type checker just ignores them.

### 12. Type checker segfaults on Any-typed closures in imported modules

**Reproduction:**
```saffron
// src/lib/test.sf contains:
fun mock(name: String) {
    var ret = nil
    var fn = fun (a: Any) => { return ret }
    ...
}
```
```saffron
import "@test" as T
T.mock("x")  // segfault
```

**Expected:** Module imports and runs.
**Actual:** Type checker crashes (segfault) when evaluating closures that capture
variables later assigned to different types (nil → Any), or when `Task.spawn(body)`
is called with an `Any`-typed param inside an imported module.

**Root cause:** The type checker dereferences NULL type pointers when resolving closure
captured variables whose initial type is nil. The cascading "Undefined variable" errors
from the type checker then trigger `runtimeError()` which corrupts VM state during import.

**Impact:** Blocks `@test` import with mock/async features. Inline usage works.
**Workaround:** Inline test functions or avoid nil-initialized captured variables.



### 21. `type` is a reserved keyword — can't use as parameter/variable name

`type` is tokenized as `TOKEN_TYPE` for type alias declarations. Code that uses `type` as a parameter name (e.g. `fun define(name: String, type: String)`) gets a parse error. Consider making it a contextual keyword (only reserved at statement start).


## Fixed

- ~~#1: Functions in imported modules can't call each other~~ — Fixed: ObjFunction now stores owning module, OP_GET_GLOBAL uses correct module context.
- ~~#3: Type checker if-block scoping~~ — Not a bug, correct behavior.
- ~~#4: @import path resolution~~ — Fixed: findModule call in parseFile.
- ~~#5: Map() not callable~~ — Fixed: set returnType on Map's init FunctorType.
- ~~#7: No string escape sequences~~ — Fixed.
- ~~#8: list vs List case~~ — Fixed.
- ~~#9: anyType not universal supertype~~ — Fixed: NODE_LIST/NODE_MAP/NODE_GET/NODE_CALL all handle anyType.
- ~~#10: Imported module functions crash~~ — Fixed: same as #1.
- ~~Nested closures crash~~ — Fixed: declareVariable for nested fun declarations.
- ~~#14: break/continue rejected in while/for loops~~ — Fixed: added loop depth tracking for NODE_WHILE and NODE_FOR.
- ~~#15: Qualified type references (`Module.Type`)~~ — Fixed: parser handles dotted names in type annotations, type checker resolves from module.
- ~~#16: Empty list not assignable to typed `List<T>` fields~~ — Fixed: NODE_SET propagates field type as currentAssignmentType; raw `List` accepted for list literals.
- ~~#17: Type checker NULL file path for relative imports~~ — Fixed: `setTypecheckFile(path)` called before `evaluateTree` in checkFile mode.
- ~~#18: Cross-module enum pattern matching~~ — Fixed: OP_IMPORT now pops the path string (was leaking on stack); match arms support dotted qualified names.
- ~~#19: GC not marking suspended call frame locals~~ — Fixed: OBJ_CALL_FRAME marking now traces `frame->stack`, `frame->stored`, `frame->result`.
- ~~#11: Flow narrowing for primitives in unions~~ — Fixed: narrowing check used `Expr.type` (TypeNode pointer) instead of `Expr.self.type` (NodeType enum) — always read as non-NODE_BINARY.
- ~~#13: Bare return without semicolon~~ — Fixed: `returnStatement()` now checks for `}` and EOF as implicit void return.
- ~~#20: List.pop() removes first element~~ — Fixed: pop now removes from `count - 1` instead of index 0.
