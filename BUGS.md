### 2. Forward references in nested closures

**Reproduction:**
```saffron
fun test() {
    fun a() { return b() }
    fun b() { return 42 }
    IO.print(a())
}
test()
```

**Expected:** Works (b is defined before a is called).
**Actual:** `Runtime error` — b is undefined when a's closure is compiled.

**Impact:** Can't write mutually recursive helper functions inside a parent scope.
**Note:** Design choice — compile-time local resolution. Same as Lua/Python.

### 6. No `break`/`continue` type checking

The compiler has break/continue infrastructure (breakJumps, continueJumps arrays) but the type checker doesn't handle NODE_BREAK/NODE_CONTINUE. Runtime works; type checker just ignores them.

### 11. Flow narrowing doesn't work for primitives in union types

**Reproduction:**
```saffron
fun test(x: Number | String) {
    if (x is Number) {
        var y = x.to_string()  // Error: "Attempting to get from invalid type"
    }
}
```

**Expected:** `x` narrows to `Number` in the then-branch.
**Actual:** Narrowing creates the scope entry but variable resolution finds the original union type from the enclosing scope.

**Workaround:** Narrowing works for class types, just not primitives.

## Fixed

- ~~#1: Functions in imported modules can't call each other~~ — Fixed: ObjFunction now stores owning module, OP_GET_GLOBAL uses correct module context.
- ~~#3: Type checker if-block scoping~~ — Not a bug, correct behavior.
- ~~#4: @import path resolution~~ — Fixed: findModule call in parseFile.
- ~~#5: Map() not callable~~ — Fixed: set returnType on Map's init FunctorType.
- ~~#7: No string escape sequences~~ — Fixed.
- ~~#8: list vs List case~~ — Fixed.
- ~~#9: anyType not universal supertype~~ — Fixed: NODE_LIST/NODE_MAP/NODE_GET/NODE_CALL all handle anyType.
- ~~#10: Imported module functions crash~~ — Fixed: same as #1.
- ~~Nested closures crash~~ — Fixed: declareVariable for nested fun declarations.
