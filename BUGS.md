# Known Bugs

## Open

### 2. Forward references in nested closures

**Reproduction:**
```saffron
fun test() {
    fun a() { return b() }
    fun b() { return 42 }
    IO.print(a())
}
test()
```

**Expected:** Works (b is defined before a is called).
**Actual:** `Runtime error` — b is undefined when a's closure is compiled.

**Impact:** Can't write mutually recursive helper functions inside a parent scope.
**Note:** Design choice — compile-time local resolution. Same as Lua/Python.

### 6. No `break`/`continue` type checking

The compiler has break/continue infrastructure (breakJumps, continueJumps arrays) but the type checker doesn't handle NODE_BREAK/NODE_CONTINUE. Runtime works; type checker just ignores them.

### 12. Type checker segfaults on Any-typed closures in imported modules

**Reproduction:**
```saffron
// src/lib/test.sf contains:
fun mock(name: String) {
    var ret = nil
    var fn = fun (a: Any) => { return ret }
    ...
}
```
```saffron
import "@test" as T
T.mock("x")  // segfault
```

**Expected:** Module imports and runs.
**Actual:** Type checker crashes (segfault) when evaluating closures that capture
variables later assigned to different types (nil → Any), or when `Task.spawn(body)`
is called with an `Any`-typed param inside an imported module.

**Root cause:** The type checker dereferences NULL type pointers when resolving closure
captured variables whose initial type is nil. The cascading "Undefined variable" errors
from the type checker then trigger `runtimeError()` which corrupts VM state during import.

**Impact:** Blocks `@test` import with mock/async features. Inline usage works.
**Workaround:** Inline test functions or avoid nil-initialized captured variables.



### 21. `type` is a reserved keyword — can't use as parameter/variable name

`type` is tokenized as `TOKEN_TYPE` for type alias declarations. Code that uses `type` as a parameter name (e.g. `fun define(name: String, type: String)`) gets a parse error. Consider making it a contextual keyword (only reserved at statement start).


### 22. Cross-module global variable access emits undefined LLVM local

**Reproduction:**
```saffron
// cache.sf
var store: CacheStore = CacheStore()

// query.sf
import "./cache.sf" as Cache
Cache.store.get(key)  // <-- generates %Cache instead of @__g_basil_src_cache_store
```

**Expected:** `Cache.store` loads from the LLVM global `@__g_<prefix>store`.
**Actual:** Codegen emits `load i64, i64* %Cache` — `%Cache` is undefined.

**Root cause:** In `codegen/expr_body.sf` MemberAccess handler (~line 208), module-prefixed
access only checks if the resolved name is a known function. If it's a module-level `var`
(global), the check falls through and tries to load from a nonexistent local variable.

**Fix:** After the known_functions check, add a `module_globals.has(mp_resolved)` check
that emits `load i64, i64* @__g_<prefix><field>` for module-level variables.

**Impact:** Blocks any library that uses module-level globals accessed cross-module
(e.g. basil's `Cache.store` singleton). Workaround: inline the global or avoid module-qualified access.

**Confirmed hitting turmeric (2026-07-30).** Not just basil: `turmeric/src/`
`router.sf`, `prelude.sf` and `index.sf` all reference `_tracking`, a real global
at `turmeric/src/signal.sf:20`, and codegen emits `load i64, i64*
%turmeric_signal__tracking` with no definition. `clang -x ir` rejects the
emitted IR, so **turmeric does not currently build** — this is the blocker, and
it was previously masked because the undefined-variable check only warned (see
#37). The same measurement found zero other occurrences across `test/*.sf`,
`src/lib/*.sf`, and the compiler's own source, so this one variable is the whole
remaining surface of #22 in-repo.

### 23. Runtime functions return untagged i64 into NaN-boxed value space

`src/runtime/runtime.sf` is compiled with `--identity-mode`, where the tag/untag
helpers are no-ops. A runtime function that returns an integer therefore hands
back a raw i64 into value space, where every other value is NaN-boxed.

```saffron
import "@os" as OS
IO.println(OS.system("exit 1"))   // prints 4.94066e-324, not 1
```

The raw `1` is reinterpreted as a subnormal double. Two distinct symptoms:

- **Printing** goes through `__any_to_string`, which dispatches on the tag,
  finds no int tag, and formats the bits as `%g`.
- **Comparison** is worse because it is silent: `OS.system(cmd) == 0` compares a
  raw `0` against a NaN-boxed `0`, so it is *always false* even though the value
  prints as `0`.

Callers that need a correct integer can bypass the runtime and declare the libc
function directly — `@extern` results are tagged properly (see
`pantry/src/commands/run.sf` `_libc_system`).

**Root cause:** `bootstrap.sh` passes `--identity-mode` when compiling
`runtime.sf`, and `typed_ptr_to_val`/`ptr_to_val` in `codegen.sf` are pure width
converters that do no tagging. Production and consumption are both untagged, so
indexing, field access and calls all work; only tag-inspecting boundaries break.

**Fix:** tag at the boundary in `runtime.sf` via `__rt_tag_ptr` (`__list_join`
is the correct precedent), never in codegen — doing both double-tags. Groups
must be converted atomically or a printing bug becomes a segfault: (a) enum
construction plus the field loads in `match_body.sf`, (b) closures plus
`gen_indirect_call`, (c) class instances plus `gen_get_field`.

**Caveat on blanket tagging:** `__gc_is_heap_ptr` (`src/runtime/gc.ll:615`)
rejects any NaN-tagged value as a heap pointer, and nothing in `gc.ll` masks
the tag before marking. So tagging a `__gc_alloc`'d pointer makes the GC stop
tracing it and sweep it while live — strictly worse than the cosmetic printing
bug. Demonstrable today: `"abcdefgh".repeat(4)` is the one function that tags a
GC-allocated buffer, and it prints correctly with no GC pressure but garbage
under it. The `rt_malloc`-based `join`/`replace` survive. Any tagging of
GC-allocated returns must land together with masking the payload in
`__gc_is_heap_ptr`. `__list_join` is safe only because it returns
`rt_malloc`'d memory.

**Related:** the `OS.*` half of this is a hardcoded tagging allowlist
(`methods_body.sf:1154-1165`) that `__os_system` is simply missing from; #24
proposes deleting the allowlist and routing all FFI through one path. Note that
`OS.foo(...)` mangles straight to `@__os_foo` and never enters the body in
`src/lib/os.sf`, so a fix must go in `src/runtime/runtime.sf`.

### 24. `@extern` boxes returns but not `i64` params — a `Ptr` type would close it

`gen_extern_call` (`src/compiler/codegen/intrinsics_body.sf:155`) unboxes every
declared C parameter type *except* `i64`, which it passes through raw:

```saffron
} else {
    // Pass i64 values directly — no untagging needed.
    // Saffron uses identity mode for pointer-as-int values (coro handles, etc.)
    call_args.push("i64 " + val)
}
```

Returns, by contrast, are boxed on every path (`i8*` → tag_ptr, `i32`/`i64` →
tag_int per the Saffron annotation, `double` → tag_float). So a NaN-boxed integer
goes *in* and a correct integer comes *out* — the C function sees garbage:

```saffron
@extern("void* malloc(i64)") fun m_alloc(size: Int): Ptr
var buf = m_alloc(64)   // malloc receives 0x7FF9000000000040, not 64
```

Confirmed live: `malloc(i64 %tagged)`, and `@process` is entirely non-functional
because `sf_process_spawn` gets a tagged `flags` — `Process.run("echo hi")`
returns `code=-1, stdout=""`. `sf_process_poll`, `_write_stdin` and every other
`i64`-param extern in `src/lib/process.sf`, `ssl.sf`, `watch.sf` are equally
affected. 114 of 224 extern declarations take an `i64` parameter.

**Wider than first written: all networking was dead.**
`@extern("i64 sf_tcp_connect(i8*, i64)")` received a tagged `port`, so the
baseline could not connect even to a local `python3 -m http.server`. Nothing
above the socket layer — `httpx`, `net.sf`, async I/O — could ever have worked.

**Why the raw passthrough exists:** roughly 49 of those 114 params are
pointer-as-int values (coroutine handles, `malloc` results, buffer addresses)
that legitimately travel untagged. Blanket untagging would corrupt them; blanket
tagging would corrupt the other 65. The signature cannot disambiguate because
both spell themselves `i64` in C and `Int` in Saffron.

**Immediate fix:** untag `i64` params exactly as the `i32` path already does.
This alone makes `@process` and all networking work, and is independently
shippable.

**Why unconditional untagging is safe here** — not, as first argued, because
handle sites "are annotated `Int`" (so are 194 of the `i64` params, handles
included; that reasoning is backwards). The real justification is arithmetic:
`__val_untag_int` masks 48 bits and sign-extends, so it is the *identity* on a
genuine address while correctly stripping a tag. All four shapes an `Int` param
can carry survive:

| value in | untag out |
|---|---|
| NaN-boxed positive int | payload |
| NaN-boxed negative int | payload (sign-extended) |
| `tag_ptr`'d handle | address, TAG_PTR stripped |
| raw address (coro handle) | unchanged — real addresses are < 2^47 |

Measured over 111 tests at `b5fd568`, comparing exact exit codes:
`gc_test` 139 → 0; `test_file` segfault → 19/20 passing; `@process`
`out=[]` → `out=[hi]`; `malloc`/`memset`/`free` correct. `test_async_io` and
`test_httpx` go 1 → 139, which is **not** a regression: they previously failed
at connect and now get far enough to hit #32.

**Not a runtime tag test.** Sniffing the top 16 bits for `0x7FF8..0x7FFA` looks
tempting but is unsound: a real integer whose payload happens to match, or a heap
address above 2^48, silently takes the wrong branch, and the cost lands in every
FFI call.

**Longer term**, the 49 pointer-as-int sites move to a `Ptr<T>` class with
auto-boxing at the FFI boundary, so the type *says* which discipline applies. Note
that annotating alone is not enough: a class used directly as an extern return type
segfaults on field access, because codegen relabels the bare address instead of
constructing an instance. The compiler must box.

**Do not** auto-box unconditionally in either direction: it trades a loud,
reproducible failure for a silent memory-corruption class.

Full design, including the `OS.*` allowlist removal and the `@intrinsic`
signature gap that share this root cause:
[docs/design/ffi-pointer-discipline.md](docs/design/ffi-pointer-discipline.md).


### 25. Method call directly on an interpolated string literal returns garbage

**Reproduction:**
```saffron
var n = 42
IO.println("${n}".length())      // 105553123967040, not 2
IO.println("x${n}y".length())    // garbage, not 4
```

**Expected:** the length of the interpolated result.
**Actual:** a raw heap address.

Binding to a variable first works, so only the direct-call form is affected:

```saffron
var s = "x${n}y"
IO.println(s.length())           // 4 — correct
```

**Root cause:** interpolation desugars in the lexer to
`"" + (expr).to_string() + ""`. The concatenation produces a raw `char*`;
assigning it to a variable goes through a path that tags it, but calling a
method on the concatenation expression directly passes the untagged pointer as
the receiver, so `length()` reads the address as if it were a value. Same
raw-pointer-leak class as #23, and the static `Ptr` distinction proposed in #24
is what would let codegen tell the two cases apart.

**Impact:** cosmetic but easy to hit — `"${x}".length()` and
`"${x}".to_upper()` silently produce nonsense rather than failing.


### 34. `bootstrap.sh` never builds a gen4, contradicting the promotion criteria

`CLAUDE.md` states, as a promotion criterion, "Gen3 can compile itself
(bootstrap a gen4 from gen3): the test stage in bootstrap.sh verifies this." The
TEST stage does not do this — it compiles and runs sample programs, never a
gen4.

The gap matters because a hand-built gen4 **does not work**: it segfaults on
`IO.println("hi")`. Verified pre-existing by building a gen4 from the unmodified
baseline, which crashes identically, so this is not a regression from any recent
change — but it does mean the documented criterion has never actually held.

Either the criterion or the script should change. Until then, promotion decisions
rest on the sample-program tests alone, and that should be stated honestly rather
than implying a self-hosting check that isn't run.

### 38. Forwarding an `await` through a wrapper function returns the handle, not the result

`Async.gather()` — shipped, documented, and used by `@promise` — returns garbage.
The awaited value comes back as the raw task handle rather than the task's
result:

```saffron
fun mk_int(): Int { Async.sleep(0.01); return 42 }
var t: Task<Int> = Task.spawn(fun () => mk_int())
IO.println(t.await().to_string())          // 42            — correct
// the same await one call frame deeper, inside a coroutine wrapper:
IO.println(Async.await(t).to_string())     // 105553180263168 — the handle
```

**Not a typing problem.** This was first mistaken for one, because a String
result printed as `5.21502e-310` (a tagged pointer read as a float) — the
signature of #32/#37. It isn't: an **`Int`** fails identically, and `Int` needs
no tag interpretation. Annotating `Task<Int>` / `Task<String>` changes the
garbage but does not fix it. A generic `await<T>(task: Task<T>): T` does not fix
it either. The value crossing the return boundary is simply the wrong value.

Narrowed by elimination — these all work, so the defect is specifically *an
await whose result is returned out of a suspending wrapper*:
- a coroutine returning a String it built itself (no await crossing)
- forwarding an awaited `Int` through a wrapper that suspends
- `Task<String>` as a parameter type across a function boundary
- `t.await()` inline at the call site, any result type

**Affected:** `Async.gather()` and `Async.race()` in `src/lib/async.sf`;
`Promise.all()` / `Promise.race()` in `src/lib/promise.sf`, which call
`Async.await`.

**Also missing:** `Async.await` does not exist in `src/lib/async.sf` at all,
though `CLAUDE.md:219` documents it and both `src/lib/promise.sf:10,26` and
`test/async_coop.sf:16-18` call it. Those fail to link
(`_stdlib_async_await` undefined) — which is why `async_coop` is at exit 1.
Adding the function is a two-line change but is **blocked on this bug**: it
would link and then silently return handles instead of results, so it must not
be added until the forwarding path is fixed. Verified pre-existing on both the
pre-#32 and pre-#37 baselines.

### 37. Method dispatch that matches no branch returns a silent zero

`gen_method_call` (`methods_body.sf`) ends with `this.last_type =
AST.Type.IntType; return "0"` and emits an error *only* when `obj_type` is a
known user class missing the method. For a builtin/`Int`/`Any`/empty `obj_type`
— exactly the "type inference failed" case — it falls through emitting **no
call at all** and hands back the literal `0`:

```saffron
fun make(): Int { return 0 }
var x = make()
x.push(5)          // no __list_push emitted; the push vanishes, x unchanged
```

This is the mechanism that turned #33 into a segfault and #36 into lost data:
whenever type inference lands on `Int` for something that isn't, the method
silently no-ops instead of failing the compile.

**Proposed fix:** make the terminal fall-through an error (`has_errors = true`)
for builtin/unknown `obj_type` too, symmetric with the user-class arm. Related
to #33's closing note.

**Progress (2026-07-30):** the `String.push` blocker is gone. It was *not* an
invalid call as originally filed — `map.get()` on an unannotated receiver
claimed `StringType` at both of its inference sites, so `toml.sf`'s
`ensure_array_table` inferred `arr: String` from `current.get(last_key)` and its
`arr.push(new_table)` fell through, silently discarding every array-of-tables
entry. Fixed by returning `Any` when the receiver isn't an annotated `Map<K, V>`
(`methods_body.sf:263` in `get_expr_type`, `:2066` in the dispatch arm).
Annotated maps still narrow to `V`, so this only widens what was already
unknown. `toml_test` 1 → 0; suite fall-throughs 8 → 7; regression test at
`test/test_map_get_types.sf` (fails on the parent commit, passes after).

**Progress (2026-07-30), part 2 — undefined variables are now errors.** The
remaining 7 fall-throughs were all `test/json.sf`, which calls `Json.parse` with
**no `import` statement at all**. Chasing that surfaced a bigger defect in the
same "silent" family: an undeclared variable produced a *warning*
(`expr_body.sf:75` and `:1403`) and then emitted `load i64, i64* %name` with no
matching alloca. The compile still failed — but as `use of undefined value
'%data'` from llc, with no source location, no recognisable name, and
`has_errors` left false, so the compiler reported success right up to the
assembler.

Both sites are now errors that set `has_errors`. Measured before changing
anything, so the "false positives in multi-module context" caveat in the old
comment could be checked rather than trusted:

| Corpus | Files | Files warning |
|---|---|---|
| `test/*.sf` | 111 | 1 (`json.sf`, genuinely broken) |
| `src/lib/*.sf` | 67 | 0 |
| `parsley` + `basil` + `turmeric` src | — | 3 (all one variable) |
| compiler's own source | ~30k lines | 0 (it self-bootstraps clean) |

The 3 app hits are all `turmeric_signal__tracking`, a real global at
`turmeric/src/signal.sf:20` unresolved across the import — i.e. **#22**, not a
false positive. Verified that turmeric's emitted IR *already* fails to assemble
(`clang -x ir` rejects `%turmeric_signal__tracking`), so the hardening does not
break anything that currently works; it converts an opaque IR failure into a
named diagnostic. Suite exit codes unchanged, `test/fail/*` output
byte-identical. Negative test at `test/fail/undefined_variable.sf` — errors and
exits 1 here, warns and exits **0** on the parent commit.

`test/json.sf` also gets its missing `import "@json" as Json`.

**Still open:** the terminal fall-through in `gen_method_call` itself. With
undefined variables now caught earlier, `test/json.sf`'s 7 hits are diagnosed at
their real cause, but the terminal still returns a silent zero for any *other*
receiver whose type inference lands on a builtin. Hardening it is now unblocked
in principle; it needs its own measurement pass over the same four corpora
before flipping, since a fall-through can also be reached by valid-but-unhandled
builtin methods rather than only by bad types.

## Fixed

- ~~#35: An await loop's body re-executes after coroutine resume~~ — **Filed on a
  wrong diagnosis; not a real loop-structure bug.** The report was written from
  observed duplicate output (`"iter i=0"` printed twice) and attributed to the
  resume path re-entering the loop body block. It was actually a *symptom of
  #32*: the same repro did `result.length()` on an awaited value whose type fell
  back to `Int`, so a String receiver reached `__list_length` and corrupted
  memory — the duplicate lines were garbage output from that corruption, not a
  second pass through the body.

  With #32 fixed (`0b7542a`), the original repro (`tasks[i].await()` over three
  network fetches) segfaults on a pre-#32 tree and prints correct output on the
  current one. Verified by *counting* side effects rather than eyeballing output
  shape, across both suspension paths — `Async.sleep` and real socket I/O: the
  pre-await statement runs exactly once per iteration and every awaited result
  accumulates.

  Regression test at `test/test_await_loop_once.sf`. Note it passes on a pre-#32
  baseline too, precisely because the duplication required #32's corruption to
  manifest; the discriminating case is the network repro, which belongs to #32.
  The test is kept because it pins the property directly by count, which no
  existing test did.

- ~~#36: `push`/`set` on an unannotated module-level list silently vanished~~ —
  Fixed. A module global declared `var _items = []` (no annotation) never had a
  type inferred, so `_items.push(x)` from any function in that module hit the
  #37 fall-through and emitted no `__list_push` — the element was dropped and
  the list stayed empty.

  ```saffron
  // lib.sf
  var _items = []
  fun add(x: Any) { _items.push(x) }
  fun count(): Int { return _items.length() }
  // main.sf:  Lib.add(5); Lib.add(10); Lib.count()  ==> was 0, now 2
  ```

  **Root cause:** the module-global pre-scan in `codegen.sf` registered a global's
  type only from its *annotation* (`get_var_type`), never from its initializer.
  Local `var`s infer through `gen_var_decl_with_name`, but a module global is
  registered by this earlier pass so functions compiled before the module init
  can resolve list/map/string dispatch — and that pass skipped inference
  entirely. So `_items` fell back to `Int`, and `.push` misdispatched.

  The fix infers from the initializer when the annotation is absent, in all
  **three** copies of the pre-scan (`generate_with_modules` and the two `flat`
  variants). Because this pass runs before function return types are registered,
  only literal shapes — list, map, string — are resolved here; that is exactly
  the `[]` / `{}` / `""` global case that misfires. `test.sf`'s `_tests`/
  `_test_errors`, `bytes.sf`'s buffers, and similar stdlib globals are covered.

  Cut the suite's silent fall-throughs from 96 to 8 (the remainder are #37's
  `Json.parse` namespace resolution and one invalid `String.push`), fixed
  `test_buffer` (17/20 → 20/20 — three assertions had been losing pushes to a
  module-global `Buffer`), and changed no other exit code across all 111 tests.


- ~~#33: `to_lower()` on a function's return value produced a null receiver~~ —
  Fixed. Filed as a String-dispatch bug; it was actually a declaration-order bug
  in return-type registration, one call frame earlier.

  The symptom was a segfault in `_platform_strstr` from `client.sf:352`
  (`transfer_enc.to_lower().contains("chunked")`). The IR skipped the
  `rt_str_to_lower` call entirely and passed a literal `0` as the receiver —
  `%t140` was allocated but never defined, the tell-tale of a `fresh_local()`
  whose branch emitted nothing.

  **Root cause:** `codegen.sf`'s pre-scan registers `func_defaults`,
  `func_param_count` and `func_param_names` for every function in every module
  before any IR generation — but *not* `func_ret_types`. That was left to
  `gen_function` (`output_body.sf:10`), which only runs when compilation reaches
  the declaration. `_recv_response` is defined *above* `_extract_header_value` in
  the same file, so at the call site the table had no entry and `last_type` fell
  back to `IntType` — the same dishonest "unknown means Int" fallback as #32.
  `transfer_enc` was then typed `Int`, `to_lower` matched neither the `String`
  nor the `Any` branch, and dispatch fell through returning nothing.

  Instrumenting the compiler was what settled it: printing `obj_type` at the
  String-method gate showed `objtype=[Int] objname=[transfer_enc]` among a dozen
  correct `[String]` dispatches, and printing registration order showed
  `_recv_response` compiled before `_extract_header_value` registered.

  The fix adds return types to the pre-scan, in all **three** copies of that loop
  (`generate_with_modules`, `generate_with_modules_flat_opts`, and
  `..._flat_opts3` — the two `flat` variants iterate `all_stmts`, not
  `df_stmts`, which the first attempt got wrong and the build caught).

  **Why it resisted isolation:** direct chains, function-returned strings,
  cross-module returns and the same chain inside a coroutine all worked, because
  each happened to have the callee registered first. Only same-module
  caller-above-callee ordering triggers it.

  `test_httpx` now passes (139 → 0) and full-suite exit codes are otherwise
  identical. Verified against a local server, since `httpbin.org` — the test's
  target — currently returns 503: `Status: 200` and a body length of exactly
  5000 bytes for a 5000-byte file, both sequentially and through two parallel
  `Task.spawn`ed requests. HTTPS reaches a real handshake (the 503 arrives over
  TLS).

  **Note:** the residual hazard is the silent fall-through, not this instance. A
  builtin-dispatch path that matches no branch returns a zero-valued register
  rather than failing the compile, so the next type-inference gap of this shape
  will also surface as a null-pointer segfault far from its cause.
- ~~#32: `__list_length` receives a tagged list pointer and segfaults~~ — Fixed,
  and the filed diagnosis was wrong in both its title and its root cause.

  The crash is not in `tasks.length()` and the tagged pointer is not a list. In
  the repro, `__list_length` receives a **String** — a NaN-tagged `char*` from
  `TAG_PTR`. Disassembling the caller settled it: the instructions immediately
  before the faulting `bl __list_length` are `strcpy`/`strcat`/`__string_intern`,
  i.e. the `i.to_string() + ": "` concatenation on the *next* line. The receiver
  is `result`, not `tasks`.

  Localizing it took a detour. Breakpoint commands (`br command add`) never fired
  before the fault, and a watchpoint on `@__g_tasks` showed only one write — the
  `__list_new()` from the declaration — proving nothing ever stored a tagged value
  into the list global. Only disassembling the return address (`__saffron_entry +
  776`) revealed the true call site.

  **Root cause:** the `await`/`getResult` branches read the result type from
  `typed_vars[get_variable_name(object)]`, and `get_variable_name` returns `""`
  for anything that is not a bare `Variable`. So `tasks[i].await()` — an
  `IndexGet` — learns nothing and the fallback applied. That fallback was
  `IntType`: a *claim* the value is an integer, when in fact the type is unknown.
  `result.length()` then took the non-String, non-Any branch and emitted
  `call i64 @__list_length(i64 %result)` on a tagged string pointer.

  The fix is to fall back to `AnyType` at all three sites. `Any` is the honest
  answer and the dispatch machinery already handles it: `__any_length`
  (`base_nanbox.ll:1186`) unmasks `TAG_PTR`, checks the GC magic sentinel, and
  routes to `strlen`/`__list_length`/map-count at runtime.

  Not the filed fix. #32 proposed untagging the receiver at
  `methods_body.sf:2201`, which would have masked the tag off a string and fed
  `__list_length` a valid-looking pointer to character data — a silent wrong
  answer in place of a loud crash. It also credited #24's `Ptr` work with fixing
  this; unrelated.

  `test_async_io` now passes end to end for the first time (all three sections:
  Sequential, Parallel, Fan-out). Verified across the full 111-test suite against
  a baseline built from the previous commit: the *only* changed exit code is
  `test_async_io` 139 → 0.

  One rough edge left deliberately: the `Any` path prints
  `[codegen] Warning: dispatching 'length' on untyped value` on stderr for code
  that is now perfectly correct. Silencing it would need real inference of a
  task's result type through a container, which is a larger change than this fix.
- ~~#28: an `Int` literal assigned to a `Float` annotation became NaN~~ — Fixed:
  `gen_var_decl_with_name` stored the literal with its `TAG_INT` intact while every
  downstream read treated the bits as a double, so `var f: Float = 1` came back as
  the subnormal `4.94e-324`, or NaN once it reached a tag-inspecting path.

  Only the declaration path was broken. Mixed arithmetic (`1 + 1.0`) always
  worked because `__val_untag_float` (`base_nanbox.ll:263`) already converts an
  int-tagged operand via `sitofp`; the fix reuses exactly that conversion as an
  untag_float/tag_float round trip rather than duplicating a `sitofp`.

  **Gated on `!identity_mode`, deliberately.** Identity mode has no tags and
  compiles `Float` arithmetic as `add i64`, so `Float` *is* `Int` there — and the
  compiler's own sources rely on that in 455 places (`var pos: Float = 0`,
  `var depth: Float = 1`, `var slash_idx: Float = -1`). Converting unconditionally
  would have corrupted every one of them.
- ~~#30: a builtin module function couldn't be passed as a value~~ — Fixed, and it
  was narrower than the write-up suggested. The MemberAccess handler in
  `expr_body.sf` *does* have a module-prefixed function-reference branch, and
  `module_prefixes` *does* map `IO -> __io_`; the branch was skipped only because
  it gates on `known_functions`, and `__io_println`/`__io_print` were the sole
  `IO.*` entries never registered there. They are special-cased earlier on the
  *call* path (`methods_body.sf:976`, `expr_body.sf:1748`), so nothing ever
  needed them in the table — until they appeared in value position, where the
  miss fell through to a load from the nonexistent local `%IO`.

  So this was not the same defect as #22: #22 is a genuinely missing branch for
  module-level globals, this was a missing table entry. `IO.read_file` and every
  `OS.*` function already worked as values.

  Registering the two names in `known_functions` and `runtime_declares()`, plus
  `func_param_count` entries (`gen_func_ref` sizes the trampoline from it and
  would otherwise emit a 0-arg `call` against a 1-param declaration), is the whole
  fix. The call path is unaffected because its special cases run first.

  This makes the `Iter.each(["a","b","c"], IO.println)` example in
  `src/lib/iter.sf`'s docstring — previously aspirational — actually run.
- ~~#29: indexing a String segfaulted~~ — Fixed: `gen_index_get` had a `Map`
  special case but nothing for `String`, so `s[0]` fell through to the list path
  and `__list_get` read a character as if it were a list header. It now
  dispatches on `last_type == "String"` — the same `last_type` that already made
  `s.length()` resolve correctly, including through an `Any` annotation — and
  calls a new `__str_get` runtime helper.

  This also makes **`for (c in "ab")` work**, since the `for-in` desugaring is
  index-based and went straight through `s[i]`.

  `__str_get` mirrors `__list_get`, not `char_at`: negative indices count from
  the end (`s[-1]`), and out of range raises a fatal IndexError instead of
  reading past the terminator. `char_at(5)` on a 2-char string still returns
  garbage silently — matching that would have been the wrong precedent. It
  allocates with `rt_malloc` rather than `__gc_alloc` because, per #23, tagging
  GC-allocated memory makes the collector sweep it while live.
- ~~#31: a nested `for-in` visited only the first element of the outer loop~~ —
  Fixed: `desugar_for_in` in `src/compiler/parser.sf` named its temporaries
  `__for_list` / `__for_i` unconditionally. Nested loops share a scope chain, so
  the inner loop redeclared the outer loop's cursor and left it past the end,
  making the outer `while` condition false on the first re-test. The names are now
  gensym'd through `Parser.next_for_uid()`, and `parse_for_in` — which carried a
  second, near-identical copy of the desugaring — delegates to the one
  implementation so the two cannot drift again.
- ~~#26: `0.0 / 0.0` printed `(null)` and faulted through a Map~~ — Fixed: canonical
  quiet NaN is `0x7FF8000000000000`, bit-identical to TAG_PTR with a null payload,
  so `__val_is_ptr` (`upper == 0x7FF8`) read every NaN as a null pointer.
  `__val_tag_float` now remaps the three colliding patterns (`0x7FF8`/`0x7FF9`/
  `0x7FFA`) to `0x7FFC000000000000`, still a quiet NaN but outside the tag range.
  Only an all-ones exponent with a set high mantissa bit can reach that range, so
  no finite double is affected. Applied to all four runtimes (`base.ll`,
  `base_nanbox.ll`, `wasm_base.ll`, `wasm_base_32.ll`).
- ~~#27: comparison operators were silently dropped inside string interpolation~~ —
  Fixed: `read_interpolation` in `src/compiler/lexer.sf` carried its own shorter
  copy of the operator table covering only `( ) + - * / . , [ ]` and discarded
  every other character, so `"${a != b}"` lexed as `a b`. Both lexers now call a
  shared `lex_operator`.
- ~~#1: Functions in imported modules can't call each other~~ — Fixed: ObjFunction now stores owning module, OP_GET_GLOBAL uses correct module context.
- ~~#3: Type checker if-block scoping~~ — Not a bug, correct behavior.
- ~~#4: @import path resolution~~ — Fixed: findModule call in parseFile.
- ~~#5: Map() not callable~~ — Fixed: set returnType on Map's init FunctorType.
- ~~#7: No string escape sequences~~ — Fixed.
- ~~#8: list vs List case~~ — Fixed.
- ~~#9: anyType not universal supertype~~ — Fixed: NODE_LIST/NODE_MAP/NODE_GET/NODE_CALL all handle anyType.
- ~~#10: Imported module functions crash~~ — Fixed: same as #1.
- ~~Nested closures crash~~ — Fixed: declareVariable for nested fun declarations.
- ~~#14: break/continue rejected in while/for loops~~ — Fixed: added loop depth tracking for NODE_WHILE and NODE_FOR.
- ~~#15: Qualified type references (`Module.Type`)~~ — Fixed: parser handles dotted names in type annotations, type checker resolves from module.
- ~~#16: Empty list not assignable to typed `List<T>` fields~~ — Fixed: NODE_SET propagates field type as currentAssignmentType; raw `List` accepted for list literals.
- ~~#17: Type checker NULL file path for relative imports~~ — Fixed: `setTypecheckFile(path)` called before `evaluateTree` in checkFile mode.
- ~~#18: Cross-module enum pattern matching~~ — Fixed: OP_IMPORT now pops the path string (was leaking on stack); match arms support dotted qualified names.
- ~~#19: GC not marking suspended call frame locals~~ — Fixed: OBJ_CALL_FRAME marking now traces `frame->stack`, `frame->stored`, `frame->result`.
- ~~#11: Flow narrowing for primitives in unions~~ — Fixed: narrowing check used `Expr.type` (TypeNode pointer) instead of `Expr.self.type` (NodeType enum) — always read as non-NODE_BINARY.
- ~~#13: Bare return without semicolon~~ — Fixed: `returnStatement()` now checks for `}` and EOF as implicit void return.
- ~~#20: List.pop() removes first element~~ — Fixed: pop now removes from `count - 1` instead of index 0.
